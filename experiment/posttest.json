      "question": "What physical mechanisms lead to the formation of an energy barrier at a metal-semiconductor junction, and how does this barrier influence carrier injection?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The energy barrier forms due to the difference in work functions, which influences carrier injection.",
        "b": "The energy barrier is created by Fermi level alignment, allowing for efficient carrier injection.",
        "c": "The barrier is caused by thermal effects, which have no significant impact on carrier injection.",
        "d": "The energy barrier is formed by the depletion region, which restricts carrier injection under equilibrium conditions."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The work function difference contributes to barrier formation, but charge redistribution and band bending also play a role.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Fermi level alignment occurs at equilibrium, but it does not directly create an energy barrier; instead, band bending leads to the barrier.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Thermal effects can influence carrier behavior but are not the primary cause of barrier formation.",
        "d": "Correct! The depletion region leads to band bending, creating an energy barrier that restricts carrier injection under equilibrium conditions."

      "question": "Discuss the impact of surface states on the performance of ohmic contacts. How do these states influence the contact resistance?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Surface states have no effect on contact resistance.",
        "b": "Surface states can trap carriers, increasing contact resistance.",
        "c": "Surface states enhance carrier mobility, reducing contact resistance.",
        "d": "Surface states only affect the thermal properties of the junction."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Surface states can significantly impact contact performance.",
        "b": "Correct! Surface states can trap carriers, leading to increased contact resistance.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Surface states typically hinder mobility rather than enhance it.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Surface states primarily influence electrical properties, not thermal."

      "question": "What are the consequences of using a metal with a significantly higher work function than the semiconductor in forming an ohmic contact?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It will always result in a low contact resistance.",
        "b": "It may lead to a rectifying contact instead of an ohmic contact.",
        "c": "It has no impact on the contact properties.",
        "d": "It will improve the thermal stability of the junction."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A higher work function does not guarantee low contact resistance.",
        "b": "Correct! A significantly higher work function can create a rectifying contact.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The work function directly affects contact properties.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While it may influence thermal stability, the primary concern is the electrical behavior."

      "question": "Analyze the role of temperature in the behavior of ohmic contacts. How does temperature variation affect the charge carrier dynamics at the junction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Temperature has no effect on charge carrier dynamics.",
        "b": "Higher temperatures increase carrier concentration and mobility, reducing contact resistance.",
        "c": "Lower temperatures enhance carrier injection, improving contact performance.",
        "d": "Temperature only affects the mechanical properties of the junction."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Temperature significantly influences charge carrier dynamics.",
        "b": "Correct! Higher temperatures generally increase carrier concentration and mobility, which can reduce contact resistance.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While lower temperatures can affect dynamics, they typically do not enhance injection.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Temperature primarily influences electrical properties, not mechanical."
